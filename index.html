			<h2 class="jockey">History</h2>
			<p class="communist">The sabre-toothed tiger is one of the most well-known prehistoric animals along with giants such as the woolly mammoth. Sabre-toothed tigers roamed the mid-western US and parts of both North and South America and were named for the enormous canines which skeletons show, protruded quite far out of their mouths.It became extinct in the Quanternary period(the end of the dinosaur period) and during the ice age.</p>

			<h2 class="jockey">Diet</h2>
			<p class="communist1">They normally fed on deer, buffalo, antelopes, camels, ground sloths, bison, and tapirs. Saber tooth cats also eat mammoths and mastodons. Smilodons had killed quite a few humans but this is not confirmed. Smilodons living in North America preyed on large herbivorous mammals such as camels and bisons. The modern-day American bisons and camels are much smaller than those living in those times. Saber-tooth cats were not only apex predators in North America they were equally successful in South America. Saber-toothed tigers competed with American lion and dire wolf. The prey territory was often overlapped among these animals. The tiger’s diet also consists of ungulates including litopterns and toxodonts. Smilodons possibly preferred eating only the flesh leaving behind the bones for scavengers.</p>

			<h2 class="jockey">Extinction</h2>
			<p class="communist2">The saber-tooth tiger was essentially hunted so heavily by primitive human populations that it became extinct. The last saber-tooth tiger is thought to have become extinct around 10,000 years ago. Palaeontologists have long assumed that sabertooth tigers, native to North America, died out because they no longer had enough food. However, a 2012 study of wear patterns on fossil teeth found no evidence to suggest starvation. Another possible explanation for sabertooths’ extinction is that North America’s climate cooled rapidly. Although dinosaurs became extinct because of this cataclysmic climate change, it didn’t affect sabertooths’ typical prey items – mammoths, camels, giant ground sloths, bison and horses – to the same degree. Habitat loss due to climate change forced these prey animals to evolve to smaller species, but they were still plentiful. However, when the first humans arrived in North America about 12,000 years ago, climate change as well as increased competition for food may have led to the extinction of many species of native megafauna.</p>

			<h3 class="jockey">Fun Facts</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="left">
			
			<p class="communist3">The canine teeth of the largest Saber Tooth Tigers were nearly a foot long. These animals used their teeth to stab their prey. One interesting and surprising fact is that as big and scary as the Saber Tooth's canine teeth were they were not very strong and could be easily broken. This mammal had to be very careful in protecting their teeth when attacking prey. The loss of these teeth would all but take away its ability to kill prey and mean certain death from starvation for the cat. Their bodies were not as sleek and muscular as today’s big cats which mean that their hunting was not that savvy. They likely depended on the juveniles in a herd of herbivores for their staple meal. They were very unlikely able to take down the large mammoths that roamed the earth. They very likely also were scavengers and fed on the carcass of dead animals. They were not as fearless as much of the reports have them as. They were large, bulky animals with small jaws and large teeth that probably got in the way a lot of the time. Saber tooth tigers may in fact been nothing more than a very large kitty cat that wanted to simply grab a quick meal that did not take a lot of effort to find and curl up under a tree somewhere.</p>
